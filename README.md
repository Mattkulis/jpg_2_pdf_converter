ensurethat the .py file is in the folder of the jpeg's you wish to convert.
name each file in chronological order ie Page1.jpg, Page2.jpg, Page3.jpg, etc..
simply navigate to this folder with cd & run the script
not necessary but to avoid error modify the script to reflect the number of pages you wish to include in the pdf: this is essential if you have more than 45 which is the set number in the script
--> folders with less than 45 will still generate properly but for those with > 45 it will stop there and your 46th and 47, 48'th etc pages will not be included.
